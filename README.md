Analyzing properties of sequence models empirically and theoretically. 

## Experimentation Framework

1. The orchestrator script:
usage: python3  orchestrator.py [-h] [--num_gpus NUM_GPUS]
                      [--exps_per_gpu EXPS_PER_GPU]
                      specification_dir out_dir

The experiment orchestrator. This takes as argument a directory containing
experiment specifications (a bunch of jsons) and the desired parallelism (# of gpus, and workers per gpu) with which to run a set of experiments

positional arguments:
 specification_dir     A directory containing experiment specifications
                       generated by specifier.py
 out_dir               The output directory

optional arguments:
 -h, --help            show this help message and exit
 --num_gpus NUM_GPUS   Number of GPUs to use
 --exps_per_gpu EXPS_PER_GPU
                       Number of examples per GPU

2. The experiment runner: exp_runner,py
-> This is the main entrypoint for experiments, there is a main function called 
        run_experiment(spec, experiment_directory): 
    this takes a dictionary called spec (which is the JSON that specifies the experiment, containing name, # of layers, learning rate, batch size, etc) 
    and then "runs an experiment" with it.
-> This method should basically output all the information we need to a directory given by "experiment_directory"
